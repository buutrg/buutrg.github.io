# Statistical Genetics enthusiast


## About me
My primary research focuses on developing and applying statistical methods for exploration of genetic architecture and genomic studies such as genome-wide association study (GWAS), polygenic risk scores (PRS), gene-by-environment analysis, RNA-Seq, and single-cell RNA-Seq analysis. I am also interested in machine learning algorithms and causal inference methods such as Bayesian network construction, potential outcome model, and matching algorithms for multi-omics data.
