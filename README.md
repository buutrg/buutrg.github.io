# Statistical Genetics enthusiast


## About me
My primary research focuses on developing and applying statistical methods for exploration of genetic architecture and genomic studies such as genome-wide association study (GWAS), polygenic risk scores (PRS), gene-by-environment analysis, RNA-Seq, and single-cell RNA-Seq analysis. I am also interested in machine learning algorithms and causal inference methods such as Bayesian network construction, potential outcome model, and matching algorithms for multi-omics data.

## Professional Experience
Harvard University – PhD student	Mar, 2023 – Sep, 2028

Advisor: Prof. Alkes L. Price and Prof. Limimg Liang

•	Developed a method to leverage polygenicity enrichment from GWAS integrating chromatin accessibility signal from scATAC-seq data to identify desease-relevant cell types.

•	Built causal network of Mendelian Randomization to investigate the inflammation interactions using proteomic data.

•	Re-evaluated the tagging power of HapMap3 variants and developed a new method to identify tagging SNPs using large-scale whole genome sequencing data and from linkage disequilibrium (LD) score.

•	Built pipeline to process large scATAC-seq data with 1.2 million cells and 1.3 million peaks.
